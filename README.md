# Number Guessing Game (Java Practice Project)

##  Project Description

This is a fun **Number Guessing Game** created in Java. The computer randomly generates a number and the player must guess it. The program gives hints whether the guess is too high or too low.

Developed as part of my **1st Semester simple practice project** to improve my understanding of loops, conditionals, and random number generation in Java.

##  Features

- Random number generation
- User input validation
- Hints after each guess
- Keeps count of attempts

##  Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17)
- Command-line interface (CLI)

##  Learning Outcome

From this project, I practiced:

- How to generate random numbers using `java.util.Random`
- Using loops (`while`, `do-while`) in Java
- Implementing conditional logic for game feedback
